# Coverity CoGuard Integration

This repository contains scripts and instructions on how to translate
a result from CoGuard into the format Coverity's third party
integration toolkit ([documentation
here](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/coverity-docs/page/coverity-analysis/topics/running_the_third_party_integration_toolkit.html))

# How to install the integration

The integration is installed as part of the [CoGuard
CLI](https://github.com/coguardio/coguard-cli). Please follow the
installation instructions there.

# How to run it inside your CI/CD pipeline

Example scripts are provided inside this repository, found
[here](./example_scripts). You can copy the scripts and
alter it for your respective use-case

## Supporting Windows

In the
[documentation](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/coverity-docs/page/coverity-analysis/topics/import_file_format_and_reference.html#cim_TPIP_import_format_examples__cim_TPIT_json),
The translated JSON requires to use forward-slashes independent on
where the script is running. Right now, we are using the operating
system path separator. [See the open issue for more
details](https://github.com/coguardio/coverity_integration/issues/1).

## File-independent flags

The third party integration toolkit requires currently a flag to be
associated to a file. Some of our checks are independent of the file,
or are even just there because the file does not exist. Right now, we
filter those checks out.

Once defects that are not tied to a file are supported in Coverity, we
will add these checks into the list.
